# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started Writing and completed my FCC Tribute Page HTML.

**Thoughts:** I really dont like front end development and have been procrastinating on doing this challenge because i suck at css, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it and loving it. I eventually finished it and it looks beautiful.
